This is a Java based bank application which is completed in collaboration with my college friend Pavan Kumar Kamra.

This project demonstrates the fundamental object-oriented programming skills in Java, especially Java interface, inheritance and polymorphism. It uses Java packages to organize the classes, and create JUnit tests.

It is a menu-based bank application that includes *Account* and *Bank* classes. The *Account* class consist of three subclasses: Savings, Chequing and GIC Classes. There is a *Taxable* interface and the application class *FinancialApp*.

Each class is coded with specific requirements and restrictions. The *FinancialApp* class shows the main menu with seven different options to run the program.

The above mentioned details were 1st part of the project which I did individually.

The 2nd part of the assignment was worked together with Pavan. In this part, we converted the *Bank* class (a local Java class) into the RMI framework and the *BankingApp* class into an RMI client.

 We also worked on the GUI of the application in this part.
